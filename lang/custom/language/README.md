# Custom language files
Do not edit the default translation files located in app/language/. If you want to have custom translations, you have to create a file here (app/custom/language/, for example en.php), and then define your custom strings in it. The custom strings will be used instead of the default translations, and they will not be overwritten by new versions of the default language files.
